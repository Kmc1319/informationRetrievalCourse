# Information Retrieval Course
Some code examples of information retrieval systems to illustrate the topics presented in [Information Retrieval course](https://estudios.unizar.es/estudio/asignatura?anyo_academico=2024&asignatura_id=30233&estudio_id=20240148&centro_id=110&plan_id_nk=439) of Computer Science Engineering Studies at Faculty of Engineering, University of Zaragoza, Spain.

Current examples:
* gensim_demo: Sample programs for indexing text/xml files, and search free text queries using the [gensim Python library](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/#documentation) .
* whoosh_demo: Sample programs for indexing text/xml files, and search free text queries using the [Whoosh Python library](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) .
* embeddings: Sample program to test how to represent documents and queries in terms of word vectors, and obtain a ranking of documents more similar to the query according to this representation. This program is based on the gensim Python library and the [Word2Vec tutorial](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/auto_examples/tutorials/run_word2vec.html).
